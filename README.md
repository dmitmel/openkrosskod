# openKrossKod

**NOTE: This is merely a proof-of-concept!!! It will probably never reach the point of being even remotely playable!! Currently the repository just contains yet another Pong clone, along with a few demo programs.**

An opensource engine for the game [CrossCode](http://cross-code.com/en/home).

Apparently a similar project exists, made by some Korean developers: <https://github.com/Knabin/crosscode>. They even have a [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMneIMFBW64) which predates my project (the implementation, not the idea though). I wish I could understand Korean.
